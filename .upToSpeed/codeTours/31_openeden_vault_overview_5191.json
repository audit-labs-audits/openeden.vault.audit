The core architectural challenge is the illiquid nature of the underlying T-Bills. The standard `redeem` function uses the `withdrawalQueue` to manage this, processing redemptions when the vault has liquid assets. `redeemIns` provides an alternative path by plugging into an external `redemptionContract`, which can offer immediate liquidity. The other options are incorrect; fees are a secondary consequence, not the primary architectural driver, and both functions are available to regular KYC-verified users.",
